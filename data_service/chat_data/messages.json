Each region has a manager and a target sales goal. For example, the South region, managed by Jane Doe, has a target of $1,200,000, while the East region, managed by Bob Johnson, has a target of $900,000.

Each product has a unique ID, a name, a category (like Electronics or Books), a price, and how many are in stock. For instance, Product_1 in the Electronics category is priced at about $142.62 and has 698 units available. This dataset helps us understand what we have to sell and at what price.\n\n### Sales\nFinally, the sales dataset shows us the transactions that have taken place. It includes details like the date of the sale, the product sold, the quantity, the unit price, and the total amount for each sale. For example, on April 12, 2024, a sale in the North region involved 8 units of a product, totaling about $2,376.38.\n\n### Total Sales by Region\nNow, looking at the total sales by region, we can see how each region is performing. The West region leads with approximately $1.68 million in sales, followed closely by the South at about $1.61 million. The North and East regions have total sales of around $1.36 million and $1.67 million, respectively. This information is crucial as it shows which regions are meeting their sales targets and which might need more attention.\n\nOverall, these insights can help us make informed decisions about where to focus our efforts, whether it's boosting sales in a particular region or managing stock levels for certain products.
